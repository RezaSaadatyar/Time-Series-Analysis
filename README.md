# Time-Series-Forecasting

Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Averages (ARIMA):
In statistics and in time series analysis, an ARIMA model is an update of ARMA (autoregressive moving average). The ARMA consists of mainly two components, the autoregressive and moving average; the ARIMA consists of an integrated moving average of autoregressive time series. ARIMA model is useful in the cases where the time series is non-stationary. 
  
ARIMA(p,d,q):
p: The order of the auto-regressive (AR) model (i.e., the number of lag observations). 
d: The degree of differencing.
q: The order of the moving average (MA) model. This is essentially the size of the “window” function over your time series data. 
An MA process is a linear combination of past errors
